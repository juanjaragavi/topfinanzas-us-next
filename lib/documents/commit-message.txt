refactor: Replace AdZep with TopAds proprietary ad system

BREAKING CHANGE: Complete removal of AdZep integration in favor of TopAds

Migrated from legacy AdZep ad system to TopAds proprietary ad network.
Removed 8 AdZep components, simplified architecture, and updated all
documentation and configuration files.

Components Deleted: 8 AdZep component files
Components Created: ad-accessibility-fix.tsx (generic, ad-provider agnostic)

Core Files Updated:
- app/layout.tsx: Removed AdZep imports and ENABLE_ADZEP flag
- lib/ads/config.ts: AdZepConfig → TopAdsConfig
- lib/logger.ts: adzepLogger → topadsLogger
- types/window.d.ts: Removed AdZepActivateAds declaration
- app/globals.css: Updated all AdZep references

Documentation Updated: 6 files including copilot-instructions, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md
Deleted Documentation: ADZEP_IMPLEMENTATION.md, ADZEP_SUMMARY.md (4 files)

Architecture Change:
  AdZep: window.AdZepActivateAds() with complex activation
  TopAds: window.topAds.spa() with simple SPA handler

Ad container IDs unchanged: square02, square03, square04

Testing: Zero TypeScript errors, no broken imports, clean build
