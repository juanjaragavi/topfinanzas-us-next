feat: implement ActiveCampaign field mapping and list assignment

## Overview
Complete implementation of ActiveCampaign API integration with field mapping, 
list subscription, and comprehensive documentation for quiz form submissions.

## Changes

### API Route Enhancement
- Updated `/app/api/activecampaign/route.ts` with two-step workflow
- Added field value mapping logic using centralized configuration
- Implemented automatic TOP US list (ID: 4) subscription
- Enhanced error logging and handling for better diagnostics

### Field Mapping Configuration (NEW)
- Created `/lib/activecampaign-field-mapping.ts` with centralized field IDs
- Defined `mapQuizDataToFieldValues()` function for data transformation
- Configured `TOP_US_LIST_ID` constant for list assignment
- Documented field mapping requirements and setup instructions

### Documentation (NEW)
- Created comprehensive field mapping guide at `/docs/ACTIVECAMPAIGN_FIELD_MAPPING.md`
- Created implementation summary at `/docs/ACTIVECAMPAIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Created field ID retrieval guide at `/docs/GET_ACTIVECAMPAIGN_FIELD_IDS.md`
- Included API reference, troubleshooting, and deployment checklists

### Testing Infrastructure (NEW)
- Created integration test script at `/scripts/test-activecampaign.ts`
- Added `npm run test:activecampaign` command to package.json
- Implemented four-step verification: contact creation, list subscription, 
  data verification, and list membership validation

## Technical Details

### Field Mapping
Maps quiz and tracking data to ActiveCampaign custom fields:
- Quiz responses: preference, income (value + text labels)
- UTM parameters: source, medium, campaign, term, content
- Metadata: country, brand, source, timestamp

### List Assignment Workflow
1. Create contact with field values via POST /api/3/contacts
2. Extract contact ID from response
3. Subscribe to TOP US list via POST /api/3/contactLists
4. Return success response to client

### Error Handling
- Contact creation failure: log error, return 500, halt workflow
- List subscription failure: log warning, return success with note
- Field mapping issues: log errors, continue with available data

## Next Steps Required

### Configuration
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Replace placeholder field IDs in `lib/activecampaign-field-mapping.ts`
1. Login to ActiveCampaign dashboard
2. Navigate to Contacts > Manage Fields
3. Document field IDs for all custom fields
4. Update `AC_FIELD_IDS` object with actual IDs

### Testing
1. Run integration test: `npm run test:activecampaign`
2. Submit quiz form manually at `/campaign-quiz-credit-card-recommender`
3. Verify contact appears in ActiveCampaign with populated fields
4. Confirm contact is subscribed to TOP US list (ID: 4)

### Deployment
- Ensure environment variables are set in production
- Monitor API logs for field mapping errors
- Validate list population after initial deployments

## Impact
- ✅ Contacts will now be automatically assigned to TOP US list
- ✅ All quiz and tracking data captured in custom fields
- ✅ UTM parameters properly tracked for campaign attribution
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation for maintenance
