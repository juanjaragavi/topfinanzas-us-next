fix: update next-mdx-remote from v5 to v6 to resolve Vercel security vulnerability

Vercel flagged next-mdx-remote 5.0.0 as vulnerable. Updated to 6.0.0 which introduces blockJS and blockDangerousJS security defaults. No code changes required as the project uses only MDXRemote and compileMDX from the RSC entrypoint with no JS expressions in MDX content.
