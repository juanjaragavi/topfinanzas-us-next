feat: Localize financial products and fix lint errors

- Replace UK search index data with US financial products from `lib/data/us-financial-products.ts`.
- Refactor `app/financial-solutions/page.tsx` and `app/page-client.tsx` to fix React Hooks violations (move `useMemo` to top level).
- Update `lib/search/index.ts` to export `searchContent` and use US data.
- Update test scripts (`scripts/test-*.js`) to use USD currency.
- Update `components/README.md` to reflect US data and compliance standards.
- Remove legacy UK string constants.
- Fix build error in `components/search/search-bar.tsx` by adding missing export.
