# Cookie Policy

**Effective Date:** January 26, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

This Cookie Policy explains how **Top Networks Inc.** ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our website [us.topfinanzas.com](https://us.topfinanzas.com) (the "Site"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

This policy should be read alongside our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which explains how we use personal information.

## 1. What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Website owners widely use cookies to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, **Top Networks Inc.**) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## 2. Why do we use cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

## 3. Types of cookies we use

The specific types of first-party and third-party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described below:

- **Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Site and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Site to you, you cannot refuse them without affecting how our Site functions.
- **Performance and functionality cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Site but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering your preferences) may become unavailable.
- **Analytics and customization cookies:** These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Site is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Site for you. We primarily use Google Analytics for this purpose.

## 4. How can you control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.

- **Browser Controls:** You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
- **Cookie Consent Tool:** On your first visit to our Site, you will be presented with a cookie notice requesting your consent for non-essential cookies. You can manage your preferences through this tool at any time (if implemented).

## 5. Third-party cookies

As mentioned, third parties such as Google Analytics may set cookies when you visit our Site. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites for analytics and performance monitoring purposes.

## 6. Updates to this Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
