# A Savvy Traveler's Guide: Using Credit Card Points for Thanksgiving Travel

<div id="square01" data-topads data-topads-size="square"></div>

Thanksgiving is a time for family, food, and gratitude. It's also, unfortunately, one of the most expensive and hectic times to travel all year. As millions of people cross the country to get to the dinner table, flight prices can skyrocket, putting a strain on any holiday budget. But what if you could significantly reduce that cost? Good news: you might be sitting on a pile of unused credit card points that can make your trip much more affordable. Mastering your travel rewards is a key part of smart personal finance, and Thanksgiving travel is the perfect time to put those skills to use.

This guide will walk you through how to leverage your credit card points to book your Thanksgiving flights, hotels, and more. From understanding your rewards to finding the best deals, we'll show you how to make your holiday journey happen without breaking the bank.

## Understanding Your Credit Card Points

Before you can use your points, you need to know what you have. Credit card rewards generally fall into two categories:

- **Bank-Specific Points**: These are points like Chase Ultimate Rewards®, American Express Membership Rewards®, or Capital One Miles. They are flexible because you can often use them through the bank's travel portal or transfer them to various airline and hotel partners.

- **Co-Branded Points**: These are points tied to a specific airline or hotel, like Delta SkyMiles or Marriott Bonvoy points, earned from co-branded credit cards. These are less flexible and can only be used with that specific brand or its direct partners.

Log into your credit card account online. There will be a section dedicated to your rewards where you can see your current balance. If you have flexible bank points, take note of the available airline transfer partners, as this is often where you'll find the most value.

## The Golden Rule: Book as Early as Possible

When it comes to using points for holiday travel, procrastination is your worst enemy. Airlines only release a limited number of "award seats"—seats that can be booked with points—on each flight. During peak times like Thanksgiving, these seats get snatched up incredibly fast.

Ideally, you should start searching and booking your Thanksgiving travel anywhere from 9 to 11 months in advance. Yes, that means you might be planning this year's turkey dinner in January! While last-minute award seats can sometimes pop up, relying on this is a risky gamble. Planning ahead gives you the best chance of finding a flight that works for your schedule.

## How to Book Your Thanksgiving Trip with Points: A Step-by-Step Guide

Ready to turn those points into a plane ticket? Here's how to approach the booking process for the best results.

### Step 1: Be Flexible with Dates and Airports

The key to successful award travel is flexibility. The Tuesday before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving are typically the busiest and most expensive days to fly. If your schedule allows, try flying on Monday, Tuesday morning, or even on Thanksgiving Day itself. For the return, consider leaving on Saturday or the following Monday. Shifting your travel dates by just one day can open up significantly more award availability and require fewer points. Also, check nearby airports. Flying into a smaller, regional airport instead of a major hub could be your ticket to finding a seat.

### Step 2: Search for Award Availability

Start your search directly on airline websites. Most have a checkbox on their search form that says "Book with Miles" or "Shop with Miles." This will show you the cost in points instead of dollars. If you have flexible bank points, search across multiple transfer partners to see who offers the best deal for your route.

### Step 3: Compare the Value and Make the Transfer

How do you know if you're getting a good deal? A simple way to check is to calculate the cent-per-point value. Divide the cash price of the ticket by the number of points required. For example, if a $400 flight costs 25,000 points, the value is 1.6 cents per point ($400 / 25,000 = $0.016). Aim for a value of 1.5 cents or higher for a solid redemption. Once you find a flight you want, and if you're using bank points, you'll need to transfer them to the airline's loyalty program. This process is usually instant but can sometimes take a day or two. Remember that these transfers are irreversible!

## Pro Tips to Maximize Your Holiday Travel

Want to get even more out of your points? Keep these strategies in mind:

- **Book One-Way Tickets**: Sometimes, booking two one-way flights on different airlines can be cheaper in points than a round-trip ticket on a single carrier.

- **Consider a Stopover**: Some airline programs allow you to add a long stopover in a connecting city for no extra points, letting you visit two destinations for the price of one.

- **Use Points + Cash**: If you're a little short on points, many programs let you pay with a combination of points and cash. This can be a great way to lower your out-of-pocket cost.

## What if You Don't Have Enough Points?

If your points balance isn't quite enough for a flight, don't despair. You can still use your rewards to offset other travel costs. Many credit card travel portals allow you to book hotels or rental cars with points. While this might not always offer the highest value, it's better than letting your points go unused. If your goal is to have enough for next year, start looking for ways to earn points now. This could include signing up for a new travel rewards card with a generous welcome bonus (if you can meet the minimum spend responsibly) or looking for other [ways to save money fast](/personal-finance/how-to-save-money-fast-10-hacks-that-actually-work/) to build up your travel fund.

## Make Your Thanksgiving Trip Happen

Navigating the world of credit card rewards can seem daunting, but the savings are well worth the effort. By planning early, staying flexible, and understanding how your points work, you can make that Thanksgiving trip home a reality without the financial stress. Smart use of rewards is a powerful personal finance tool that puts you in control, letting you focus on what truly matters: spending time with loved ones.
